# Coding Challenge

## External Libraries
- **React.JS**, 
  I use ReactJS because I strongly believe it's more professional than using Backbone + jQuery. ReactJS does not just abstract DOM, it offers an API that lets me compose and nest small and focused Components. Also it encourages writing code that follows the principle of "one-directional data flow", which I find much easier to understand and debug.
